# NeetCode Roadmap

This folder mirrors the NeetCode roadmap (https://neetcode.io/roadmap). Each subfolder represents a topic where you can add problem solutions, notes, and links.

Folder layout (simplified names):

- `arrays_and_hashing/`
- `two_pointers/`
- `binary_search/`
- `sliding_window/`
- `stack/`
- `heap/`
- `linked_list/`
- `trees/`
- `trie/`
- `graphs/`
- `dynamic_programming/`
- `greedy/`
- `backtracking/`
- `math/`
- `bit_manipulation/`
- `design/`
- `intervals/`
- `union_find/`
- `topological_sort/`
- `recursion/`

Add solutions inside the appropriate folder. Each problem file should include the problem number, title, and language (for example `0001_two_sum.py`).
